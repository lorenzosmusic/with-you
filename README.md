# With you
## This is the Ardour DAW file for the song "With you" by Lorenzo's Music.

This is a song recorded by the abstract deconstruction creative commons band [Lorenzo's Music](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=bandlink&utm_campaign=withyoureadme) using only open-source tools and software.

We decided to create an experimental recording method. We thought of a way to use **GitHub for music** to record remotely with the recording software **Ardour and Ubuntu Studio**. And this is the first song from that experiment.

# The GitHub for music Concept
Since **Ardour** is all controlled by a main code file and distributes the used tracks to folders from that file that it could be version controlled by GitHub. The band could share our sessions and create branches for each new idea track or idea that was made to the song using the the full Ardour sessions with audio and all!

Here is the final recording from this experiment on YouTube

We use Github for the working Ardour files of our songs to collaborate, make changes and record our parts outside of the studio.

View the description of the original idea for this **Github for music** process on our website [Brainstorming Using Github For Mmusic With Ubuntu Sstudio And Ardour To Record Remotely.](https://www.lorenzosmusic.com/2020/11/brainstorming-using-github-for-music.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=articlelink&utm_campaign=withyoureadme)

We use the free and open source [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) based operating system [Ubuntu Studio](https://ubuntustudio.org/). The Ubuntu studio OS has programs and plug-ins for this project preinstalled and ready to use.

The song is recorded with [Ardour](https://ardour.org/) an open-source digital audio workstation.

Most of the effects used come from the open-source audio effects software projects [Calf Studio Gear](https://calf-studio-gear.org/) or [Guitarix virtual guitar amplifier plugins](https://guitarix.org/).

# Requirements
* **Ardour DAW** [https://ardour.org](https://ardour.org/) Recording Software that is used for these file so you will need to install this!
* **Git LFS** [https://git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/). This needs to be installed to access the large .wav files of the recording on Github or else there won't be any music to hear in the recording :)

## Not required but needed
**Effects**

These should be installed to recreate the actual version of the song we made, but the recording is still able to work without them, it will just sound different without these effects.
* **Calf** Plugins Effects. [https://calf-studio-gear.org](https://calf-studio-gear.org/). These are the EQ and compression effects. These are only available for Linux operating systems but some of them come pre-installed in Ardour. If you can't install them the songs will still play the original files without these efects.
* **Guitarix** The guitar pedal effects used on the tracks. Sadly these are only available for Linux. You can still play the files without them if you are on another operating system you will just hear the un altered sounds. - [https://guitarix.org](https://guitarix.org/)

# If you already use Ubuntu Studio
The only thing you you need to install is  **Git LFS** [https://git-lfs.github.com](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to download the large .wav files from the GitHub repository.

# Note: Error when opening file
You will get a missing files error message when opening this file. When we were recording the song there was an imported track that we deleted. It still looks for it for some reason?

**It is not needed so you can ignore this.**
* select skip all missing files
* Click continue

If you create anything from this song, remix it or build anything from it let us know! We would love to hear it!
